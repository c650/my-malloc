# My Malloc

This is an experiment. I set out to learn more about how memory management is accomplished on Linux systems. Specifically, I wanted to do it in C. I aim to mimic the bare-bones functionality of GLIBC's malloc.

Again, this is a learning experience -- and as of now this code shouldn't really be used or relied on.
